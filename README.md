📌 Project Overview

The AI Badminton Smash Performance Analyzer is a real-time Computer Vision application built using OpenCV + MediaPipe Pose.

It analyzes badminton smash mechanics by:

Detecting full-body landmarks

Calculating joint angles

Tracking jump height

Generating a smash performance score

This project demonstrates real-time pose estimation, biomechanical angle analysis, and performance scoring using Python.

🎯 Features

✅ Real-time pose detection
✅ Elbow extension angle calculation
✅ Knee bend angle calculation
✅ Jump height estimation
✅ Smash performance scoring
✅ Live on-screen analytics

🧠 How It Works

Webcam captures video stream.

MediaPipe detects 33 body landmarks.

Joint angles are calculated using vector math.

Jump height is estimated using ankle Y-coordinate tracking.

A weighted scoring formula evaluates smash performance.

Results are displayed live on screen.
